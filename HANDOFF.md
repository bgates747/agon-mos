# Interrupt-based UART0 transmission project — handoff

Executive summary: the UART0 candidate is integrated into MOS and passes native
ZDS II, scripted, production-ROM and both headless Flexe engine tests on Oryx.
The Author selected callback/session exclusion and retain-and-wait exit handling.
The Author passed Oryx human review on 2026-10-13 and authorized committing
and pushing this tranche. Physical qualification remains pending.

Read `/Agon/mystuff/agon-dev-env/codex/AGENTS.md`, then `OWNERSHIP.md`, `TODO.md`,
`docs/uart0-async.md`, `docs/tasks/ASY-001.md` and the latest dated development log.
The sole unfinished-work checklist is TODO.md. Immutable IDs use the form
`TX-006 [ ]`; never renumber or reuse one. Current pending work is fresh-lease
physical qualification TX-006; human acceptance TX-010 is complete.

## Source and contract

Branch: `codex/uart0-async`; remote: `bgates747/agon-mos`. The clean starting
checkpoint `b20af31` was already pushed when the Author said to commit/push dirt
and proceed. The Author subsequently accepted production-tranche human
validation and authorized its commit/push. Existing qsort edits were previously preserved and committed
separately as `564de93`; this tranche does not change them.

`src/uart0_tx.inc` is the common tested core; the isolated wrapper includes it.
`src/uart0_async.asm` supplies BSS/startup, parser routing, synchronous scopes,
polling, return fences and UTX1 discovery via existing getfunction index 13h.
No new high-level MOS call number is allocated. The register ABI and limits
are documented in `docs/uart0-async.md` and remain a development API in this fork.

C-001: async open refuses an installed user keyboard callback; installing or
clearing one first drains/closes an open session. Existing callbacks retain
ISR timing and synchronous output. Async apps use MOS keyboard state/map/polling.
C-002: return fences retain borrowed sources until queue empty and TEMT. A
permanent CTS stall waits indefinitely until explicit reset. OSCLI fences before
child loading. No automatic FIFO/parser flush or unsafe timeout is used.

RST38 drains/closes an intact foreground consumer. Panic during an open UART
consumer retains RAM in a stopped loop for reset. Closed-session legacy panic
behavior is retained. Corruption and direct private UART/state manipulation are
outside the normal-return guarantee.

## Build and evidence

`bash tools/zds/build.sh` builds the complete native MOS image on Oryx under Wine.
`bash experiments/uart0-mos/build.sh` reproduces native building, the 1,411-case
scripted suite and seven negative controls, 13 production-ROM scenarios, and
both full-image headless engines. All C/Rust/assembly compilation and emulation
run on Oryx; local Ruby/Bash only stage, inventory and check results.
No mos-agondev/AgonDev translation route is maintained. No C source workaround
was needed: do not reintroduce the incorrect compiler `-model:L` option.

Build artifacts are ignored under `build/uart0-mos`; durable summary and
commands live in `experiments/uart0-mos/README.md` and `results.json`. The final
full reproduction took 48.455 seconds, excluding initial runtime/tool setup.
Emulator wall times are scheduling measurements, not hardware performance.

The emulator has its own owner/agent in `../flexe-agon-emulator`; do not modify
its ongoing work. MOS uses cached copies of the previously qualified binaries
pinned by `experiments/uart0-mos/runtime.sha256`. Initial cache seeding can use
the earlier qualified MOS profile, and fails if its hashes differ. The original
emulator/source provenance is retained in the earlier Flexe manifest and logs.
The generated profile explicitly identifies and hashes this candidate MOS ROM;
it must not claim to contain stock v3.0.2. The old isolated fixture's profile
scripts can replace it, so rerunning them replaces the reviewed production fixture.

## Accepted Oryx human review

Run locally on Oryx:

```bash
cd ~/Agon/mystuff/agon-mos/.emulator
./flexe-agon-emulator --precise-interrupts
```

Expect legacy, ordered, masked, exit/return, short-mode and integration PASS
markers. The final invalid-command error is deliberate. At `/uart *`, type
`ECHO UART0 KEYBOARD PASS` and confirm the response and normal prompt.
The Author supplied the expected screen and a successful typed `dir` command,
then explicitly reported "passed". The agent ran only headless tests; human
review was performed by the Author. The Fab launcher is a compatibility
shim to the primary Flexe entry point.

No physical bench or firmware was touched. Obtain a fresh explicit bench lease
before physical qualification or firmware writes. Receiver headroom, physical
full-duplex timing, recovered CPU work and game integration remain unqualified.
Do not remove game DI blocks or modify another owner's profiles/sources.
